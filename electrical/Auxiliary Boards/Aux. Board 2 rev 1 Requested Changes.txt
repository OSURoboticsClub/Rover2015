Potential Issues of Aux. Board 2 rev. 1
=======================================

---------
-Add board name and revision number to the silkscreen.

-Add a 0.1uF capacitor between 5V and ground.
 (Even slow CMOS logic exhibits terrible ground bounce without adequate decoupling.)

-The AM26LV32IDR has an absolute maximum voltage of 3.6V!
 The ST26C32ABDR (Digikey 497-2066-1-ND) appears to be a 5V equivalent.
