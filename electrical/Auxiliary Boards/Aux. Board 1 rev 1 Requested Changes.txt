Potential Issues of Aux. Board 1 rev. 1
=======================================

---------
-Through-hole pads would be vastly more secure than surface-mount ones.
 Seriously, soldering wires directly to surface pads is going to end in tears.
 Using through-hole pads could also reduce the size of the board.

-Why are the A+ and A- pads so far away from each other? Making them
 adjacent would even simply the board routing.

-Consider placing a 0.1uF capacitor between 5V and Gnd.
 It can't hurt, and may give us a bit more noise margin.
 
-Add an outline or note on the silkscreen to indicate that the connector
 should be mounted on the bottom side.
 
-Add board name and revision number to the silkscreen.

-These boards are small enough that fabricating them with OSHPark may be the cheapest option.
 (Especially if moving to through-hole pads shrinks the board size.)
 Including (free) shipping, we could get 3 boards for $3.50 ($1.17 per board, or $7.00 for six).
 I've created a CAM job for generating OSHPark-compatible gerbers, so that's not an issue.
