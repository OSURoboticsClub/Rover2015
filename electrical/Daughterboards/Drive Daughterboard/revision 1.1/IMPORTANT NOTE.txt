Important Note on Soldermask Layers
===================================
I assumed that PADS acted like every other PCB program
and generated the soldermask layer automatically, so I didn't
create solder mask apertures while making my footprints. As a
result, the board file has no solder mask openings.
This may cause a problem if we submit the file directly to
DFRobot, depending on if they create the openings for us.

The gerber files have solder mask openings copied from the
copper layers. I've previewed the gerbers using OSHPark, and
I believe that they are correct. We should be able to
use them to order the PCBs and stencils.



Less Important Notes on Other Aspects of the Design
===================================================
-I've changed the colors in the drive board schematic. The top layer is red,
 and the bottom layer is blue.
-The design BOM describes each component individually, including its function.
-The Assembly/Ordering BOM groups components of the same type together.
-Gerber files were prepared according to OSHPark's naming system.
