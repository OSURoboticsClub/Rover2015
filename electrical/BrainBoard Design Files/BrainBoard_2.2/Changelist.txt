Changelist for this revision:

- Fix JTAG Header
  - Incorrect Pitch on BOM
  - Purchase shroud (to ensure correct direction)
- Fix USB Connector Footprint
  - Mounting holes in wrong position
- Holes for the power connector pins are too large
- Power connector footprint missing hole for retaining pin.
- [Optional] Power connector would be better in opposite polarity (ground contacts first)
- Add method of keying BrainBoard so that it can only be inserted one way
- Vias!
- Labeled Test points at relevant positions
  - Main voltages
  - Oscillator
  - etc
- Break out 5v to daughter boards
- If possible, orient parts with an eye for reflowing the board
- Keep in mind DCDC position on board
  - Place on top if possible?
- Linear reg footprint is incorrect (small pins slightly too far apart)
- Pins 14 and 15 of the microcontroller need to be swapped (gnd and vcc on the "left" side)
- Remove C18
  - Required on megas, not on XMegas.
- Change R8, R9, and R10 to ~150 ohm resistors (RGB LED Resistors)
  - RGB LED is too bright with ~70 ohm resistors

Cosmetic / Not-Physical Changes:
- Pin 1 marking on the microcontroller footprint is too subtle (dot!)
- General Reference Designators illegible / toosmall
- Silkscreen says HW version instead of actual revision version
- U13 and U8 are inductiors, should be L3 and L4
- +/- near power connector pins (debugging help)
- Label for switch
- Label for LEDs
- Serial Number Spot
  
BOM Fixes (including things mentioned previously)
- JTAG Header wrong pitch / change to shrouded version
- .1uf Cap wrong part ordered / not enough (Could be Nick's fault) (Note: C7 should have a >16V rating)
- L1 Wrong size part on BOM
- L2 not on BOM
- Resonator footprint wrong size for hand soldering


Other Notes: 
- Has the filtering arrangement for the main power rail been tested? I was under the impression that it was a bad idea to include inductors in a power supply filter without a lossy element (like a resistor), as the inductor and filter capacitor will form a resonant circuit. (Ferrite beads are OK, as they're designed to be lossy.)
