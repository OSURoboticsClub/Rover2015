Potential Issues with Brainboard HW revision 3
======================================================

-A diode should be connected between the 5V regulator's Vin and Vout,
 to prevent it from blowing up when the usb cable is connected without a 24V supply present.
 Most regulators cannot handle the output pin being at a higher voltage than the input.

-The BOM doesn't have a female header for J2. I've found that Digikey's 2x14 pin female headers
 are very expensive, and they only stock machine-pin types. (Machine pin female headers
 are unsuitable for this application because they have a high insertion force and
 most can't tolerate .025 square pins.)
 To get around this, I decided to build the daughterboard sockets out of two generic 1x14 female headers.
